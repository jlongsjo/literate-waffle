 &#13;
I am thinking for the firewall request specifically, we add an approval stage back to the requestor identifying the change has been implemented and requires there approval of the service?&#13;
 &#13;
This should be global for all non-generic requests.&#13;
 &#13;
Thoughts?&#13;

Sorry for the delay Sheila&#13;
 &#13;
I spoke with Gerald and his comments are below. Adding Ian. The service now team will jump in and make sure we address this.&#13;
 &#13;
Scott, I just spoke to David over the phone and helped him understand where the process broke down. I would like to speak to you and get your input on ideas to fix the workflow if you have some time.&#13;

Brad, It is getting late in the day, and I need to get back with David.  Do you want me to have him reach out to Scott?&#13;

This is not the first time I have seen that the tickets are being closed complete but yet the customers are NOT getting what is needed.&#13;
 &#13;
I can look into what happened on this one. Let me get back to this chain with my findings.&#13;
 &#13;
Thanks&#13;

Jeff / Scott,&#13;
Who would be the one to look into this? We have a frustrated customer here, and if the story below is accurate, I can empathize.&#13;

How do you want to handle this?  David wants to follow up with someone in IS&amp;T on this.  I can send it to Chuck if you like. &#13;

Please see the ticket below, unfortunately it is not actually completed, I still do not have access to Oracle on prod.  I hate to bother you with this as I know you are very busy, but I have been trying for 3 weeks to just get access to the Oracle apps on prod, and I have gotten nowhere.  I suspect this is more a measure of my not being able to navigate the system as anything, but this pertains to a very high profile project (the PeopleSoft migration) and my not being able to view invoices in prod is hampering that effort.&#13;
 &#13;
I also know this is not protocol and that I should go through the proper channels, but I have not been able to find out what the proper channels are.  Dave and Scott have been very helpful, but I do not think they are who I should be talking to for this.  If you could guide me in the right direction as to how to solve this task I would be very grateful.&#13;
 &#13;
Thank you in advance for your help&#13;
