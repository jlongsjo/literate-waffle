Subject: Distribution List Short Description&#13;
&#13;
Good Morning Fella's, &#13;
 &#13;
AS we are now taking over DL's administration from Security I noticed that the request item was moved out of the Security Service Catalog into the IT Catalog. Not sure who made the move but I was not told of this and users called asking where the request item is. All in all we were able to find it and I advised the team of the move.&#13;
 &#13;
Can we update the short description? Take out Security Support and just leave Distribution List Request? Is this something I can do and if so how? In Service Desk I was able to update items and I'm always willing to help you guys. Thanks!&#13;
