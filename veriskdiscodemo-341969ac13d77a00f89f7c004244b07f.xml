This is not a user problem.  This is a system problem.  I don't care if a ticket is opened and closed 50 times.  It should always present in the users queue as pending work.&#13;
 &#13;
Advise on options to resolve.&#13;

True. The CATTASK state is pending since it was changed back from "Closed Complete" state. However, reopening the CATTASK on a request does not reopen the request as it has moved ahead per its associated workflow steps.&#13;
 &#13;
With that said, you can use the below link to see all the tasks pending/open for you and work on them.&#13;

Hi Piyush,&#13;
 &#13;
What I was referring is the below:&#13;
 &#13;
The CATTASK was closed by you on 06/06/2017 9:23:07 EDT.  &#13;
&#13;
With this action the parent request "RITM0106009" was completed. &#13;
&#13;
However you can still get all those closed tasks by removing the "Active = true" filter in your "My Work" query.  Here is the link:&#13;
https://verisk.service-now.com/task_list.do?sysparm_query=assigned_to%3Djavascript%3AgetMyAssignments()%5EstateNOT%20IN6%5Estate!%3D3%5EORstate%3DNULL%5Estate!%3D4%5EORstate%3DNULL&#13;

The ticket is still in open and currently assigned to me but I cannot see it in my list.&#13;
Please kindly advice how do I handle those ticket which are not visible to us. In this case, I remember the ticket number so I query directly from ticket number but  there may be more which may have assigned to me but not visible in queue like this?&#13;
 &#13;

Hi Piyush,&#13;
 &#13;
From the history it shows that this task was closed and reopened.  Once a Catalog Task is closed, it's no longer active since the workflow associated with the parent requested item (RITMxxxxx) has already moved forward. &#13;
The "My Work" query will only show Active Task assigned to you. That is why this task no longer appears in your list.&#13;
Thanks.&#13;
